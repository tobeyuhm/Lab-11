FY2025 opening cash $1,407.916M            History    Cash, cash equivalents, plus short-term investments reported on the FY2025 balance sheet; grouped as cash in this simplified model.
FY2025 opening PP&E $146.571M              History    Reported net property and equipment at December 31, 2025.
FY2025 opening other assets $240.582M      History    Total assets less cash and PP&E; grouped solely to keep the simplified model tied to the filing.
FY2025 opening liabilities $385.356M       History    Reported total liabilities at December 31, 2025.
FY2025 opening equity $1,409.713M          History    Reported total stockholders' equity at December 31, 2025.
FY2025 shares 915.077M                     History    Shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2025.
2026-30 revenue: 75/300/800/1,800/3,500    Judgment   I model a staged launch and route build-out, not a percentage growth rate on a tiny pre-commercial revenue base. Certification, fleet deployment, and customer demand would change it.
2026-30 gross margin: 35/40/45/50/55%      Judgment   Early operations should carry low utilization and fixed operating costs; margin improves only as routes and aircraft utilization scale. Actual service pricing, maintenance, and load factor data would change it.
2026-30 R&D: 650/700/775/850/900           Judgment   Engineering, certification, manufacturing-readiness, and autonomy work remain material throughout the forecast. A certification decision or a disclosed production plan would change it.
2026-30 SG&A: 190/240/325/425/525          Judgment   Commercial operations require selling, dispatch, regulatory, and corporate infrastructure. A disclosed launch geography or staffing plan would change it.
2026-30 capex: 90/125/180/240/300          Judgment   Fleet, tooling, facilities, and operating infrastructure must grow with launch. Company guidance or signed fleet/facility commitments would change it.
Depreciation = 22.86% of opening PP&E      History    FY2025 property-and-equipment depreciation of $33.5M divided by FY2025 ending PP&E of $146.571M; held constant as a simplification.
21% cash tax rate on positive pretax income Judgment  Joby has losses and a tax rate is not meaningful historically. I use the U.S. federal statutory rate only after profitability; tax attributes and foreign mix would change it.
$300M cash floor                            Judgment   I retain a large buffer because Joby is pre-commercial and depends on continued development spending. A funded runway plan or contracted cash inflows would change it.
Equity funding at $6.22/share               Judgment   The model raises only what is needed to preserve the cash floor, at the September 24, 2026 quoted price. A future offering price, debt financing, or strategic investment would change it.
No floor plan                                History    None: Joby reported no inventory in its FY2023-25 balance sheets and is not a vehicle dealer; dealer floor-plan debt is inapplicable.
13% cost of equity                           Judgment   A pre-profit aerospace company has unusually high execution, regulatory, and dilution risk. A defensible beta/capital-structure analysis would change it.
3% terminal growth                           Judgment   This is a mature-economy long-run constraint, not management guidance. A sustainable mature aviation growth outlook would change it.
$6.22 market quote (Sept. 24, 2026)         History    The observed market comparison quote is not used to produce the model value; it is shown only for the required same-share-count question.
